# PySync
A python tool for syncing files with another machine.

# Warning
This tool is intended as a learning project for myself. It is nowhere near finished and not tested at all.
Use at your own risk.

# Basic Usage
For information about the use of the program refer to the help pages

The program will search for a connection on a server to send/receive files through sockets.
